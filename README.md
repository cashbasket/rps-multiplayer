# Rock, Paper, Scissors: Multiplayer Edition

**Rock, Paper, Scissors: Multiplayer Edition** is a web app that allows two users to play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against each other, and chat (tastefully) while doing so. It was developed using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) as the "backend."

## How to Play

To start a game, just enter your name into the text field, and click the "Start" button.  You'll have to find a friend to play with, of course; otherwise, you'll most likely be waiting around forever.

Once two people are in the game, Player 1 will be asked to choose rock, paper, or scissors by clicking the appropriate button. When Player 1 has made a selection, Player 2 will then be asked to do the same, and when both players have made their choice, the winner's name will be displayed, and the wins/losses counters will be updated, and the next round will begin.

If a player leaves the game, the other player will have to wait for a new person to join.

If two players are already in the game, you will be notified that two people are already playing, and will not be able to see the gameplay or the chat.  You will only be able to see the names of the players and the wins/losses counters.

## How to Chat

Chatting is easy! Just type your message into the field below the chat window, and press "Enter" or click the "Send" button. Sending terrible messages to each other is not impossible, but it is strongly discouraged.  If you try to send JavaScript, then you should be ashamed. (Also, it won't work.)

NOTE: the chat window will only be displayed if two players are in the game, and once a player leaves, the chat will be wiped clean and the window will disappear until a new player joins the game.
